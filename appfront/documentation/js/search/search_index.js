For the sake fo the number of components, EVERY component\nwill contain *.component.ts (component logic), *.component.html (component template) and *.component.scss (component styles).\n\n📁 driver - Contains views for drivers.\n📁 _modals - Contains shared pop-up modal components for driver views.\n📁 cancelleddeployment - Contains cancelled deployment notification pop-up.\n🧩 cancelleddeployment.component\n\n\n📁 newdeployment - Contains new deployment notification pop-up.\n🧩 newdeployment.component\n\n\n\n\n📁 dashboard - Contains driver's dashboard view.\n🧩 dashboard.component\n\n\n📁 drivinghistory - Contains driver's driving history view.\n🧩 drivinghistory.component\n\n\n📁 overview - Contains driver's overview, i.e. driver's current deployment view.\n🧩 overview.component\n\n\n🔀 routes.ts - Contains routes available to driver.\n\n\n📁 manager - Contains views for manager.\n📁 _modals - Contains shared pop-up modal components for manager views.\n📁 changedrivermodal - Contains pop-up for manager to change deployment's driver.\n🧩 changedrivermodal.component\n\n\n📁 confirmcanceldeployment - Contains pop-up for manager to confirm cancellation of a deployment.\n🧩 confirmcanceldeployment.component\n\n\n📁 driverhistorymodal - Contains pop-up for manager to view selected driver's history.\n🧩 driverhistorymodal.component\n\n\n📁 routemodals - Contains modals for bus routes/services.\n📁 addroute - Contains pop-up for manager to add a new route.\n🧩 addroute.component\n\n\n📁 deleteroute - Contains pop-up for manager to delete a route.\n🧩 deleteroute.component\n\n\n📁 editroute - Contains pop-up for manager to edit an existing route.\n🧩 editroute.component\n\n\n\n\n📁 stopmodals - Contains modals for bus stops.\n📁 addstop - Contains pop-up for manager to add a new bus stop.\n🧩 addstop.component\n\n\n📁 deletestop - Contains pop-up for manager to delete a bus stop.\n🧩 deletestop.component\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📁 busdrivers - Contains manager's bus driver management view.\n🧩 dashboard.component\n\n\n📁 busroute - Contains manager's bus routes and bus stops management view.\n🧩 busroute.component\n\n\n📁 deployment - Contains manager's deployment management view.\n🧩 deployment.component\n\n\n📁 register - Contains manager's bus driver registration view.\n🧩 register.component\n\n\n📁 request - Contains manager's new requests management view.\n🧩 request.component\n\n\n🔀 routes.ts - Contains routes available to manager.\n\n\n📁 page404 - Contains shared view if 404 error is returned.\n🧩 page404.component\n\n\n📁 page500 - Contains shared view if 500 error is returned.\n🧩 page500.component\n\n\n\nSetup Instructions\nThese instructions assume that you have cloned the Git repo, and into /var/www.\n\nFirst, ensure you are in frontend directory.\n\nExample :$ cd /var/www/BusBuddy/appfront\nInstall necessary packages.\n\nExample :$ sudo npm install\nNow, the frontend is ready. It can be deployed on http://localhost:4200 using\n\nExample :$ sudo ng serve -host 0.0.0.0Deploying as Service\n\nTo use nginx for deployment, we shall first configure the frontend to query the correct port of backend.\n\nExample :$ sudo nano /var/www/BusBuddy/appfront/src/app/services/api.service.ts\nYou should see an attribute in the ApiService class, HOST. Replace the localhost string to the correct\nIP address of your virtual machine.\nThen, build the frontend. The default output should be ~/BusBuddy/appfront/dist.\n\nExample :$ sudo ng build\nInstall nginx into the virtual machine.\n\nExample :$ sudo apt install nginx\nIn /etc/nginx/sites-available, access the default available sites.\n\nExample :$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default\nAssuming the built output is indeed in ~/BusBuddy/appfront/dist, change the following.\nComment out listen [::]:80 default_server. This line might cause issues with deployment.\nChange the root to /var/www/BusBuddy/appfront/dist/appfront/browser.\nYou can change the server_name to whatever you like.\n\n\nThen, run nginx.\n\nExample :$ sudo systemctl start nginx\n$ sudo systemctl enable nginx\n$ sudo systemctl status nginx\nAfter the above, the terminal should that the service is running. It should be running on port 80.\n\n\nPre-configured Users\n\n\n\nEmail\nPassword\nAccess\nName\n\n\n\n\ntest@gmail.com\n12345\nManager\nTest\n\n\n1@driver.com\n111\nDriver\nDriver
